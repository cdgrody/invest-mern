## Coming Soon
- AAU, I want to be able to see a percent change in each holding from my original investment.
- AAU, I want to be able to see timestamps on the x-axis instead of whole numbers.
- AAU, I want to see a smoothed chart on the year scale (maybe see weekly or monthly increments)
- AAU, when I sell off all holdings, the row for that holding disappers.
- AAU, when a transaction does not work, I want UI indicating that the transaction failed.
- AAU, I want a button where I can directly sell some or all of my holdings on the holdings table.
- AAU, I want to be able to repeat a transaction by clicking on it in the transaction list.
- AAU, I want to integrate the ChatGPT API to give users investing advice.
- AAU, I want historical data to take into account when I first purchased each asset instead of just a backwards extrapolation of my current portfolio value.
