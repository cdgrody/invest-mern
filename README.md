## MassLight Interview Scenario
A client has assigned me a project to create a trading platform that has the look and feel of an app like robinhood.  The client wants to be able to use fake money to try out multiple investing strategies and view historical performance.  Ultimately, the client wants this app to become a one stop shop for training oneâ€™s investment ability by providing them with current financial news, an AI chatbot to discuss strategies, a platform to execute fake transactions, and a social media element to receive feedback from other users.  Right now, I have developed the trading platfrom element of this request, and am presenting it to you all to display and improve.

- AAU, I want to see a smoothed chart on the year scale (maybe see weekly or monthly increments)
- AAU, when a transaction does not work, I want UI indicating that the transaction failed.
- AAU, I want to be able to repeat a transaction by clicking on it in the transaction list.
- AAU, I want to integrate the ChatGPT API to give users investing advice.
